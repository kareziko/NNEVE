# Feature flow

This project uses
**[GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow){:target="\_blank"}**
as it's main workflow model. Simplified visualization can be seen on graph
below:

```mermaid
    %%{init: { 'theme': 'forest' , 'themeVariables': {
              'git0': '#4db85f',
              'git1': '#49b391',
              'git2': '#59a7ff',
              'git3': '#d93261',
              'git4': '#00ffff',
              'git5': '#ffff00',
              'git6': '#ff00ff',
              'git7': '#00ffff'
       } } }%%
    gitGraph
        commit tag:"0.0.0"

        branch feature
        checkout feature

        branch private
        checkout private

        commit
        commit

        checkout feature
        merge private

        branch private2
        checkout private2

        commit
        commit

        checkout feature
        merge private2

        commit tag:"1.0.0"

        checkout main
        merge feature
```

## Clone repository

!!! Hint

    You can skip this step if you already have a clone

```
git clone https://github.com/Argmaster/nneve.git
```

## Checking out main branch

Make sure we are on `main` branch.

```
git checkout main
```

## Pull changes from origin

!!! Hint

    You can skip this step if you just cloned the repository

```
git pull --ff
```

## Create feature branch

Create new branch for our feature called (replace with whatever you want)
`feature_name`. `feature/` prefix is required because of convention.

[Learn about branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging){:target="\_blank"}

```
git checkout -b feature/feature_name
```

## Check repository status

```
git status
```

Result should be similar to this:

```
On branch feature/feature_name
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Commit-test-push cycle

Your work on a feature should be divided into many steps during
which you will add new units to the system. Each unit should
have a set of tests to verify its operation.

1. ### Formatting & Quality checks

    Run code quality checks with tox to quickly fix most obvious issues in your code.

    ```
    tox -e check
    ```


    ```
    tox -e check
    ```

2. ### Run test suite for Python interpreter versions you have locally

    Run [test suites](/develop/tox_basics/#pyxx){:target="\_blank"} on available interpreters with

    ```
    tox -e py37
    ```

    If the tests fail, you have to repeat steps 1 and 2. Omission of the
    corrections will result in your changes being rejected by the CI
    tests executed for the pull request.

3. ### Add all changes to staging area with

    ```
    git add *
    ```

    You can list file paths instead of using the asterisk symbol if you know
    you can add many unwanted files. If these unwanted files regularly appear
    in the codebase, add them to the `.gitignore` file.

4. ### Check staging area

    ```
    git status
    ```

    If any files staged for commit shouldn't be there, unstage them with

    ```
    git restore --staged <file>
    ```

5. ### Commit changes

    Now use commit command to send changes to git history

    ```
    git commit
    ```

    This command will open text editor for you, waiting for
    commit description. You can use

    ```
    git commit -m "commit message"
    ```

    to add commit title and omit long description.
    The commit title should not be longer than 50 characters.

    - [Good Commit Messages: A Practical Git Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/){:target="\_blank"}

6. ### Push changes to remote branch

    ```
    git push -u origin feature/feature_name
    ```

    For each subsequent push from this branch, you can omit `-u origin feature/feature_name`

    ```
    git push
    ```

## Create pull request

Visit [pull requests](https://github.com/Argmaster/nneve/pulls){:target="\_blank"}
and create [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#pull-request){:target="\_blank"}
for you feature. Read in [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request){:target="\_blank"} about pull requests.

## Request review & wait for CI checks

Now you can request a pull request review, as it's described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review){:target="\_blank"}.
Before your changes can be merged into another branch, at least one person should see them,
and share their thoughts about them with you. If you are prompted to make corrections, do so immediately
and do not apply your changes without fixes. Go back to [Commit-test-push](#commit-test-push-cycle).

You changes should also pass all tests ran by CI system ([Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions){:target="\_blank"}).
If the tests fail, corrections will also be required before continuing.

## Merge PR

After receiving a positive response from the reviewer and passing the tests, the pull request can be merged.
